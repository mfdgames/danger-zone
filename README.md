# danger-zone
A quick strategy game based on trapping your opponent on the inner edge of the playing field. With intuitive thinking, it can be mastered.
This game is based on the Desert Sands Unified School District Math Field Day, which takes place annually in the Coachella Valley. A stimulating way to apply logical strategy, I hope this also appeals to a larger audience!
